Lesson 11

As you may have guessed from the previous 10 blogs, we start with logging onto our computers getting our stations all set up ready for a task we will be given. This lesson we started by coming to the projector and having a look at who did and didn't do the homework or who couldn’t hand it in properly. Then we were shown how to hand it in properly, and had a look at examples that people had handed in properly to see what came up. We got to see different prezis and see if they were good or bad. We looked at three to be precise and learnt from theirs to see how we could improve. Then we given a task at the end to see other people’s blogs and do a task and answer questions on what we thought of theirs and I know of course this would be a walk in the park right you can’t beat mine so we did that and people who didn’t hand it in correctly got told how to do it.
