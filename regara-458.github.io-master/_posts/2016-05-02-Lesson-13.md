Lesson 13

In this lesson we did our morning ritual of walking in logging on I usually have my blog on one monitor and then we get ready for the task which this time there wasn't much to write about it but I’ll try my very best. On our email we were given a link which we clicked on and were told to follow the instructions. In fact I’m sorry I missed one of the first parts as before the link we watched the Harry Potter scene with the sorting hat and were told we were going to make it on a microbit. So first we did the instructions which was make the sorting hat for Hogwarts. After making it we filled out a table on questions then we went on the challenge making it able to do it with "shake" and have our school houses instead. He then talked to us about some code and what the computer does which was “Display” so he gave us ideas and we had to make the same thing on a javascript coder so we did as much as possible before finishing it for homework.
