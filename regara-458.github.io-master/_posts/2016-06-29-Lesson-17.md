Lesson 17

I'm afraid there isn’t too much to talk about but I’ll say as much as I can. So after logging on in a new room we were asked to check our email for a link to a survey. We had to complete the survey and then hand it in. Since I had finished these other pieces of work me and a partner were asked to make a game or more precisely choose one we liked and make a plan sheet that was all for the lesson.

Thank you for reading from the author
