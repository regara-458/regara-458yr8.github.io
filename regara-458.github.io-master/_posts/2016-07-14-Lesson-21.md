Lesson 21

In this lesson as usual we logged in sat down and got ready for the lesson. This time we all had a look at some of our homework finding and memorising some facts off of the revenge porn news articles site and the sexting one. We discussed our personal views on what we thought they were and what kind of people were doing them. After this he gave us a much more detailed view on what it is how sexting can be going on as young as eleven. We kept going into this sort of stuff and how you must report it. However we had to cut the lesson short due to the fact we (well me and another boy) had a tennis match and that was the end.

Thanks for reading
