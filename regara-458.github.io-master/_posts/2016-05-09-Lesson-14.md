Lesson 14

To start this lesson we logged on as you would know got the screens ready for work. We were told that there was a link/s for us and on them were the instructions for learning how to do several things on a microbit e.g. rolling dice and getting moods. We did as many instructions as possible and then were shown the extensions and were expected to complete them so after completing them we were told the homework and then had to do our blog posts.

Thanks for reading
