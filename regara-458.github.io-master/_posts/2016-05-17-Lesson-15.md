Lesson 15

To start of the lesson we signed in got the computers running but had an unexpected turn of events instead of staying inside the classroom for the whole lesson we got to go outside, not physically outside on grass like outside of the classroom. We ventured to a new part of the school and there we were greeted with these strange boxes and were told to carry them back to the classroom. As we were leaving with the boxes one by one he told us if you drop one you owe me one thousand pounds. After this he opened one up showed us all the pieces of this crazy computer and robotic arm and then for the rest of the lesson same like last one we completed more tasks on the assignment for how to build different code on a micro bit.

Thanks for reading
