Lesson 9

In today's lesson like usual we came in logged on to our computers got our stations set up all ready to roll as everyone was ready we came to the front to get instruction’s.  As we all calmed down our teacher checked who hadn’t done their homework and then we moved on and were told of a sad picture of war and were told how many different things were going on I seem to remember it was the war in vietnam with a girl and family running away from the forest. Also we learnt looked at a website called prezi of how to make great presentations. This was part of the easter homework making presentations on computer history. Anyways we were shown a video of what prezi is and what it can do. Our teacher showed us how good prezi can be once you’ve had practise. It also can trick you how amazing the slides and orientation of everything can be which is really good to keep the people you’re presenting to interested. After this we had to create a prezi account and then we gave it a go and played with it.
