Lesson 3

As per usual we come into the classroom and go to our computers we log on get the stuff we did for homework on the screen and come to the front. We get given with instructions to check each other's homework and give it a grade unsatisfactory below average satisfactory good and excellent. This week’s homework to answer questions on a type of media we chose it could be an advert or a tv show. 

After that part of the lesson we made a table good parts of social media and bad parts good parts including: keeping in touch with friends, free texting, and posting photos, bad parts including: grooming, trolling and cyberbullying. After the table was done full of points we chose ourselves groups of 4 and collected about 10 to 20 pieces of paper with sentences on them to do with social media so we had to line them up in harmless to terribly dangerous.

After that we walked around the classroom looking at other people's ones and then came back to our seats.After that we talked about all of our uses of social media and took on board what we had learnt we then got told about this week’s homework and how it would be harder than last weeks to get into a doc format.
