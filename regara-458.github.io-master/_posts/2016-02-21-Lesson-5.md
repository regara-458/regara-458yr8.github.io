Lesson 5

In this lesson I was only there for 30 minutes as I had to depart somewhere. Anyways in the lesson we went to our computers logged on got our homework up as per usual and left our stations and came to the front. Our teacher asked loads of questions like: where you surprised by the answers?, What was new that you learned?, Anything you wouldn't expect? etc. Then he told us about the classwork that I missed and what to do for homework. The questions were for the homework which was to interview someone and ask them some questions on their social media use.
