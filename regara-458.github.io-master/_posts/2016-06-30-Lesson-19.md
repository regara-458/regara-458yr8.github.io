Lesson 19

To start off the lesson we went to our new places  in the new room where we'd be working with Apple macs. However we logged in and we went to the progress we’d made with our games. He then asked everyone to continue making their games, but if you had a faulty website loading issues he asked people like this to come to the front of the classroom to see if he could help. For most he did but mine didn’t so we had to make a whole new website since my code had a problem connecting to a thing called redcarpet so we made a whole new website and that was that.

Second Half

In the second half I just personalised the website a little bit colour and all of that font colouring until I had a working blog and knew how to update all of the posts. After this had been sorted out I went to work on my micro bit game Rock Paper Scissors which is soon to be finished and then before we knew it it was time to go.
