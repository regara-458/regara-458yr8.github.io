Lesson 20

In this lesson we were back in our original room and as we came in there was a sense of urgency and then we realised the microbits were here we were all very excited. We plugged them into computers and then put the code in them they worked perfectly. However shortly after the fun stopped we were asked to go in groups and discuss the consequences of the internet we did this for ten minutes and then we were asked to suggest ideas about the matter. Us as well as others came to the conclusion Pornography, Sexting, grooming and paedophilia.

This was the end of the lesson and we got given our homework to find articles on Revenge porn and sexting.
