Lesson 12

In this lesson as by now I'm sure you must of worked it out we went to our stations logged on and went to the front for further instructions. We came to the front and were told that these things called micro bits were meant to come a month a go. So he showed us the website and what theyâ€™re used for coding so pretty much for the rest of the lesson after watching our teacher show a tutorial of one coding unit we went to our places. We were asked play with it so we did created cool coding instructions and made the microbit do cool tricks.Then we were asked to log off and then left the lesson.

Thanks for reading
