Lesson 7

As usual we came in logged on got our blogs on screen. We then sat at our stations and waited for any instructions. We talked about homework who did it and who didn't. We then saw the teacher explain to the people who failed the homework how to do it. Next a boy in the class was spotted with gum and said he was given it by someone and then there was a discussion about betrayal and snitching. We then went on to watch some video’s about people doing very stupid things and we had to choose an answer and that would effect the next video we did all of them and saw the bad outcome and learned a big lesson think before you act and don’t eat more than you can chew since if you put too many bad video’s something bad will happen 

Thanks for reading
