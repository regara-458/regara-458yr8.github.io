Lesson 18

In this lesson we had finished our planning sheets, hopefully but we were shown how to make them better so had to improve them. We learnt a more professional way of presenting these things. This was by putting a bold font for titles and spacing it out equally this has not only affected me but everyone else. This took up ten minutes so after it he asked everyone have we finished the tutorials I had and  some others had not. So for the people who finished them they were asked to go ahead and start making their games. Unfortunately I had spent just about ten minutes on the game when we had to put a link for my blog that I'd tried to fix but struggled with anyways I and the rest of the class made files for our ICT stuff which took about five to ten minutes.

Second Half

In this half of the lesson I was busy doing two things one fixing my blog which was really hard it had the coding in the right place just seemed to not work. I checked the email sent and still nothing. Anyways for the duration I was making the game and that involved learning skills from the tutorial and before I knew it end of the lesson.

Thanks for reading from the author
